## Description

In this project, I applied the skills I acquired in the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) course from my nanodegree program to develop a landmark classifier. The goal was to predict the location of an image based on discernible landmarks when location metadata is unavailable. This is particularly relevant for photo sharing and storage services that benefit from enhanced features like automatic tagging and photo organization.

## Project Objectives

- **Create a CNN from Scratch**: I built a convolutional neural network to classify landmarks, focusing on data visualization, preprocessing, and network architecture design.
- **Transfer Learning**: I explored various pre-trained models, selecting one for the classification task and fine-tuning it for improved performance.
- **Deploy an Application**: I developed a simple app using my best model, allowing users to upload images and predict landmarks.

## Project Steps

1. **Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (from Scratch)**
    
    - Visualized the dataset.
    - Processed data for training.
    - Built a CNN architecture from scratch.
    - Exported the best network using Torch Script.
2. **Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (using Transfer Learning)**
    
    - Investigated and selected a suitable pre-trained model.
    - Trained and tested the transfer-learned network.
    - Documented my rationale behind the model choice.
    - Exported the best transfer learning model using Torch Script.
3. **Deploy Your Algorithm in an App**
    
    - Created an application to utilize the best model for predicting landmarks.
    - Tested the model and reflected on its strengths and weaknesses.
